# Private Cloud Deployment documentation

## Profile

One-click installation makes Lanying IM Proprietary Cloud worry-free and efficient. With Private Cloud, you can complete control over your data and services, and access to all services unlimitedly.

With cutting-edge container technology, all Lanying IM services have completed Cloud-native transformation, commit to smooth, stable and reliable operation of bare-metal servers, private cloud platforms, and other on-premise container platforms.

Lanying IM Private Deployment provides two deployment modes: Single server version and cluster version. 3 operates, 10 minutes to setup, the Console provides a concise state monitoring page for controlling system running state in real-time.

## Create application

[Login Console](https://console.lanyingim.com) Click to create application. Your application will use Free Edition package by default, or can be upgraded to Business Edition.

## Setup Private Cloud

Installation prerequisites

* OS：

> Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 or CentOS 7/8 recommended

> Raspberry Pie: Ubuntu 18.04 rasp3 recommended

> MacOS: Catalina 10.15 recommended

* Hardware configuration：

> Quad-core CPU, 8 G RAM, 100 G hard disk

* 3 or more servers required if you choose to install Cluster version

* The installation methods are divided into online installation and offline installation. Offline installation does not require access to the internet. It is suitable for installation on servers without internet, but the license needs to be activated once a month. Now only Ubuntu 18.04 is supported.

### Single server version

1.First, get a server ready for Private Deployment and log ssh on to it. Then, execute the download installation script command and elevate the executable permissions. The command is as follows:

```
wget https://package.lanyingim.com/linux/amd64/maxim.ctl && sudo chmod u+x maxim.ctl
```

Screenshot of execution result:

![Single server version installation: Step 1](../assets/2-1.install_single_s1.png)

2.Run installation

* Ensure your server to install on has a public network IP, and execute the following command to start.

```
sudo ./maxim.ctl install --token INSTALL_TOKEN
```

Note: “Enter maxim install token” hint, means please enter your copied installation token to continue.

Screenshot of execution started:

![Single server version installation: Step 2](../assets/2-2.install_single_s2.png)

Screenshot of installation completed

![Single server version installation: Step 3](../assets/2-3.install_single_s3.png)

* The local environment is not accessible externally, and the parameter --net internal needs to be added during installation to prompt the installer to select intranet IP registration.

Execute the following command to start installation

```
sudo ./maxim.ctl install --net internal --token INSTALL_TOKEN
```

Hint: The installation script hints “Enter maxim install token”, means please enter the copied installation token to continue.

### Single server version (Offline installation)

1.Download [Offline Installation Package](https://package.lanyingim.com/lanying-im/lanying-im-server.iso), and upload it to the server for private deployment.

2.Execute the following command to mount the offline installation package and add maxim.ctl to the executable path.

```
mkdir -p /lanying && mount -o loop lanying-im-server*.iso /lanying && cp /lanying/maxim.ctl /usr/bin/
```
Screenshot of execution result:

![Mount the offline installation package and add maxim.ctl to the executable path](../assets/offline_mount_and_add_exec.png)

3.Generate offline configuration file

[Login Console](https://console.lanyingim.com), select the APP, enter the Private Cloud page, generate an offline configuration file, and upload it to the server.

Screenshot of the operation:

![generate offline configuration file](../assets/generate_offline_install_configration.png)

4.Run installation

```
sudo maxim.ctl install --config-file maxim.*.conf
```

Screenshot of execution started:

![Single version (offline installation) start installation](../assets/single_offline_start_install.png)

Screenshot of installation completed

![Single version (offline installation) installation completed](../assets/single_offline_finish_install.png)

Hint: Wait for the installation to complete, which takes about 15 minutes.

5.Generate Cluster LicenseKey
```
sudo maxim.ctl export license-key
```
Screenshot of the execution result:

![Generate Cluster LicenseKey](../assets/single_offline_export_license_key.png)

6.Activate the cluster

On the Private Cloud page of the Console, click Activate Cluster, in the pop-up dialog box, select the cluster capacity
, enter the LicenseKey, click "Activate Cluster", and then execute the obtained activation command in the cluster

Screenshot of the operation:

## Notes

1. After the service is installed, you need to contact the server for self-inspection. If it is determined that the local environment cannot be accessed externally, you need to add the parameter --net internal to prompt the installer to select intranet IP registration.
2. If the host has a firewall, you need to ensure that ports 443 and 80 are accessible.
3. How to check Private Cloud installation progress and data migration status?

![Click “Private Cloud” to view the installation progress through the progress of node information](../assets/4-1.install_progress.png)

1. After installation completed, open Lanying IM Console to enter System Status page.

![If all checks are normal, means the service is normal](../assets/4-2.service_status.png)
