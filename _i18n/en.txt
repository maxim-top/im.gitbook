docs/index.html/div/div/p = Maximtop is a one-click IM cloud service based on multi-cloud architecture. Enterprises can quickly add chat functions to applications by integrating instant messaging IM SDK and using cloud services. After SDK integrated, the typical application architecture is as follows:
docs/index.html/div/div/figure/figcaption = Maximtop open platform architecture
docs/index.html/div/div/p = With the accumulation of instant messaging IM technology for more than ten years, Maximtop IM SDK and service API have been optimized to provide more professional services through simpler interfaces.
docs/index.html/div/div/p = One-click enable multi-cloud architecture, which is the unique advantage of Maximtop IM Cloud Service.
docs/index.html/div/div/p = One-click enable means from basic functions to service customization, all can be opened and used with one-click operation on the console; Multi-cloud architecture supports free migration of applications in different deployment modes of Public Cloud, Proprietary Cloud and Private Cloud, conforming to the business development stages, and implementing worry-free, seamless platform migration and switching.
docs/index.html/div/div/p = With the omnipotent console, there are only two things you need to do, one is to integrate Maximtop IM SDK on the client side, and the other is to connect Maximtop API service on the server side. This paper mainly introduces the work related to client SDK integration.
docs/index.html/div/div/p = Maximtop IM SDK is cross-platform, including mobile (iOS/Android), PC desktop (Linux/Windows/Mac), Web browser (including H5) and WeChat applet. In order to maximize reuse and improve service quality, the IM SDK technology stack of Maximtop is as follows:
docs/index.html/div/div/figure/figcaption = Maximtop IM SDK technology stack
docs/index.html/div/div/ol/li/p = Unified design and implementation of binary instant messaging protocol XSYNC, providing C++ version and JavaScript version respectively;
docs/index.html/div/div/ol/li/p = Encapsulate the C++ SDK of the whole platform based on C++ communication library, and continue to encapsulate the SDK of mobile (iOS/Android) and PC desktop (Linux/Windows/Mac) on this basis;
docs/index.html/div/div/ol/li/p = Both mobile terminals encapsulate the local UI Kit library before implementing the Maximtop DemoApp, but iOS and Android are slightly different. iOS encapsulates SDK through Object-C and then further transforms it into Swift library, while Android directly encapsulates Java library for upper layer use through Swig framework and JNI technology;
docs/index.html/div/div/ol/li/p = PC desktop encapsulates C++ communication library through Electron, and shares a set of UI components implemented by Vue.js with Web browser end;
docs/index.html/div/div/ol/li/p = Javascript communication library is provided to the Web browser (including H5) after being encrypted and encapsulated by WebAssembly;
docs/index.html/div/div/ol/li/p = WeChat applet is different from Web browser except protocol library due to platform reasons. The system layer calls WeChat's network and repository, and the upper layer uses WeChat's UI Kit;
docs/index.html/div/div/p = Before you start integrating all clients, you need to create an application through Maximtop console, get the AppID of the application and set it on each side.
docs/index.html/div/div/ol/li = Create account

docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = Maximtop IM SDK (codename floo) is implemented in C++, and each platform (Android, iOS, Linux, etc.) is encapsulated on this basis to complete the development of local library, so as to achieve the purpose of multi-platform reuse and keep the consistency of cross-platform protocol implementation. Floo-Android, as a native application library for Android, has two APIs available to developers, namely, low-level API and high-level API, in other words synchronous interface and asynchronous interface.
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/attr-id = Low level-api-low-level
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = Synchronous interface, the class name ends with Service, which is represented by L/S in the following description for easier understanding, where L stands for Low-level and S for Sync.
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = As mentioned earlier, floo-android entity is
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = generated by framework automatically. Its java code is generated by SWIG, invokes the underlaying C++ class library by JNI, so most interfaces are synchronous, that is, the result is returned after interface invoked.
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = In code generation and transformation process, related data structures are directly mapped to the underlying class library for reducing memory copies, so its performance is close to calling the underlying library directly.
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = Synchronous service classes are as follows:
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXClient: SDK aggregation class, which contains all service classes and implements network event listening interface
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXChatService: message sending, message history retrieval, session list
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXUserService: Register account, login, logout, my settings
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXRosterService: Friend list, blacklist
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXGroupService: Group management (create, dissolve, search, set, member management, invite, apply, accept, reject)
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/attr-id = High level-api-high-level
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = Asynchronous interface, and the class name ends with Manager, which is represented by H/A for easier understanding, where H for High-level and A for Async.
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = We also re-encapsulated high-level API based on this class, using a more friendly data structure and completing asynchronous encapsulation for development integration.
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = Simply put, the related call performs specific actions on child thread (for example, searching for friends), and the current thread will return result directly without blocking. The result of the action is notified to the caller through a callback function, where the caller can handle business logic such as UI refresh.
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/p = Asynchronous service classes are as follows:
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BaseManeger:Manger: Manage basic classes
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = ChatManager: Message sending, message history retrieval, session list
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = UserManager: Register account, login, logout, my settings

docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXNetworkListener: Network event listening interface, implemented by BMXClient
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXConversation: Session
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXMessage: Message
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXGroup: Group
docs/quick/android.html/div/div/pre/code = BMXRosterItem roster item (friend, stranger, blacklist, former friend)

docs/quick/api.html/div/div/attr-id = api classification
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/p = MaxIM API is mainly divided into user API, friend API, group API, message API and push API.
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/ul/li/p = Users belong to a single App, which is the foundation of instant messaging. Only with users can we realize the functions of friends and groups. User data is divided into basic information and setting information. Basic information includes email address, mobile number, username and password. Setting information includes whether to download thumbnails and files automatically, whether to confirm the invitation to join group, etc. Generally speaking, the user API mainly involves the update of its basic information and user settings, and the related API starts with
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/ul/li/p = , followed by specific resources, ex. “GET /user/settings” to get user settings API.
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/ul/li/p = Friend is the relationship between users. In MaxIM friendship design, users can set remarks for friends, set the notification method of friend messages, apply for adding friends, and blacklist a friend. Friend API provides friend information, friend application, friend list, friend blacklist and other related operations, and its API starts with
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/ul/li/p = .
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/ul/li/p = Groups enable multi-user communication. In MaxIM design, the roles of group members are divided into group Owners, group Admins and group Members, and the authority levels are lowered in turn. The group Owners have all the permissions of the group, while the Admins have the permissions to operate group members and modify group information settings. According to group settings, ordinary group Members may have or not have the permissions to modify group information and invite users to join group. The functional design of group membership includes invitation to join group, application to join group, set group blacklist and group ban list. The main APIs include group data operations and group member operations. Group data operations mainly include create group, dissolve group, transfer group Owner, update group information and group settings, group announcement operation, group shared file operation; and group member operations mainly include invite user to join group, Admin process invitation, user apply to join group, user process application, set group blacklist, set group ban list, user quit group, kick user out of group, etc. APIs start with
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/ul/li/p = Message API
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/ul/li/p = Message APIs are encapsulations of IM services designed to provide an easy way for messaging. Message APIs start with
docs/quick/api.html/div/div/p = In general, the API requested to MaxIM service will return an http code of 200 in case of a business error, and a MaxIM custom error code will be returned in the response body. See the Error Code page for the specific meaning of error code.

docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p = Maximtop Push is developed based on Maximtop IM technology, which can have both push and IM services with only one integration, improving R&D efficiency and greatly reducing IT expenditure of enterprises.
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p = Since the channels of major vendors are supported by default, in order to further reduce the difficulty of integration, certificate settings and updating mechanism are also built into the implementation of Maximtop Push. Simply put, after Maximtop Push integrated, developer only needs to set the certificates pushed by each vendor on the console, and the front end will package the vendor push SDKs, which can automatically complete the adaptation of the system vendor. It is no longer necessary to adjust the application and settings of various push tokens.
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p = Note: Unlike other push vendors, Maximtop Push SDK focuses on the construction and serving of push channels, and does not collect terminal information. If you have similar advertising business, you need to integrate the advertising SDK separately, or set business data tags through the interface before you can use it.
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p = As mentioned earlier, since Maximtop Push SDK and IM SDK are the same SDK, the push function only adds a push interface to the original IM SDK. Therefore, the integration method is the same as that of IM SDK, and the quick integration document can also be found in
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p/a = Maximtop IM for Android Quick Integration
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p/a = Maximtop IM for iOS Quick Integration
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p = Push function mainly involves the following three classes:
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p = Where BMXPushService and BMXPushManager are both push setting classes, the former is a synchronous calling class, and the latter is an asynchronous calling class. You can choose one according to needs when implementing.
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/p = Other functional classes are:
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/ul/li = BMXCallBack : Untyped interface callback
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/ul/li/t = : Generic type with data callback
docs/quick/push.html/div/div/ul/li = BMXPushServiceListener : Push event listening
